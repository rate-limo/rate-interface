/**
 * The connect-or-create chooser, mounted ONCE and opened from anywhere.
 *
 * Lifted out of `Shell/WalletButton`, where it was local state and therefore
 * reachable only by clicking that one button. Every other control that needs a
 * wallet — the watchlist star today, and whatever is gated next — now opens this
 * through `requestWalletConnect` instead of inventing its own handling. See
 * `lib/wallet/connectGate` for why the request is a module store rather than a
 * provider.
 *
 * Everything below is the markup that already shipped, including the copy
 * decisions, which are load-bearing and were argued once:
 *
 *   * "Connect or create a wallet", not "Log in or sign up" — there is no
 *     account to log into, no email, no password, no server-side identity. Both
 *     options produce a WALLET. Login language promises a credential this venue
 *     has never had and sets the wrong expectation about recovery.
 *   * A visible way out, worded as the visitor's own decision. Escape and the
 *     backdrop both dismiss, but neither is an affordance, and a dialog whose
 *     only exits are invisible reads as a wall. Most of the venue is readable
 *     without a wallet.
 *   * Each option says what it means FOR CHAINS, because on this venue that is
 *     the one way the two genuinely differ in daily use, and it is invisible
 *     until the first trade. READING is multichain either way — the aggregator
 *     serves every chain over HTTP and no wallet is involved. SIGNING is not: an
 *     injected wallet signs only for its current network, so trading a market on
 *     another chain interrupts with a switch prompt. The passkey connector names
 *     the chain in each transaction (see `lib/wallet/meraConnector.ts`), so it
 *     has no ambient current network to be wrong and never asks.
 *
 *     Said HERE rather than at the switch prompt because this is where the
 *     choice is actually made: someone picking an extension is choosing that
 *     prompt for every cross-chain trade they will ever make. One clause each
 *     and not a comparison table — the dialog's job is still to get them a
 *     wallet, not to argue a case.
