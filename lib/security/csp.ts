/**
 * Content Security Policy, for both origins this deployment serves.
 *
 * Two policies, because the two origins have opposite problems.
 *
 * ## The wallet frame: strict, enforced, small surface
 *
 * `/wallet-frame*` runs nothing but the frame and holds the key. Its policy
 * is enforced from day one: nonce-only scripts, connect to the chain RPCs and
 * nothing else, embeddable by the app origins alone. See `walletFrameCsp`.
 *
 * ## The app: enforce what cannot break, REPORT the rest first
 *
 * The app loads a vendored TradingView bundle, Vercel's analytics, token logos
 * from whatever host a token list names, QR codes, gateways over WebSocket,
 * public RPCs on two dozen chains for the bridge's balance reads, and a
 * bridge SDK whose API hosts are not in its published types. A strict policy
 * written from reading the code WILL be wrong somewhere, and a wrong enforced
 * CSP fails silently: the page renders, a chart or a balance is simply
 * missing, and nothing says why.
 *
 * So the app ships two headers:
 *
 *  - The ENFORCED part, holding only the directives no resource on the page
 *    can trip: `frame-ancestors 'self'` (clickjacking), `object-src 'none'`,
 *    `base-uri 'self'`. Real protection, zero risk. Delivered as
 *    `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` plus a meta tag — see ENFORCED_DIRECTIVES
 *    for why it must not be a `Content-Security-Policy` header.
 *  - `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`, holding the full policy. The
 *    browser evaluates it, blocks nothing, and posts every violation to
 *    `/api/csp-report`, which logs them. Once the logs are quiet for a
 *    representative stretch of use, promote it: in `proxy.ts`'s
 *    `withAppHeaders` set the RESPONSE header `Content-Security-Policy` to
 *    `csp.reportOnly` (it carries the nonce, so being copied onto the request
 *    is then harmless), and keep the report-only header for a release to
 *    catch stragglers. The meta tag and X-Frame-Options can stay.
 *
 * Nonces need dynamic rendering. Every route under `[locale]` is already
 * server-rendered per request (the site rows read content on each request),
 * so nothing became dynamic for this.
 *
 * ## Pure
 *
 * No I/O: the inputs are the nonce and the hosts, so the policy that gates
 * every script on the site has a test for its shape.

/**
 * The directives the app enforces today. Nothing on the page can trip these.
 *
 * They are NOT sent as a `Content-Security-Policy` header, and the reason is
 * what cost three preview deployments: on Vercel, every `headers()` entry from
 * next.config.ts is applied to the REQUEST the render receives as well as to
 * the response, and Next reads its script nonce from the request's
 * `content-security-policy` before ever looking at the report-only header. A
 * nonce-less enforced header under that name therefore silently untagged
 * every Next chunk (1 of 45 scripts carried the nonce). Locally the same
 * shadowing happens by a different route: the proxy's response headers are
 * copied onto the request.
 *
 * So the enforced part rides two carriers Next never reads and browsers
 * honour everywhere: `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` for the clickjacking rule
 * (equivalent to `frame-ancestors 'self'`), and a `<meta http-equiv>` tag in
 * the layout for the two directives meta supports. `frame-ancestors` and
 * `report-uri` are ignored in meta by spec, which is why the split is exactly
 * this.
