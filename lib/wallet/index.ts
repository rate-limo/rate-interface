/**
 * The app's wallet interface. Every component imports from here, never from a
 * vendor SDK directly.
 *
 * ## Why the indirection
 *
 * Four swaps now — AppKit → Privy → AppKit → Privy → none. The first cost 17
 * files because there was no seam; every one since has cost two, because 15
 * components import these hooks rather than an SDK. The current answer is no
 * vendor at all: wagmi connectors, one of them a passkey account of our own.
 * Keep components off `wagmi/connectors` for the same reason they were kept off
 * the SDKs.
 *
 * ## What belongs behind it
 *
 * Connect/disconnect and account identity. **Not** transactions: `useWriteContract`,
 * `useSignTypedData` and `usePublicClient` come straight from wagmi and are
 * already vendor-neutral, because AppKit plugs in as a wagmi connector.
 * Wrapping those would be indirection with nothing behind it.
 *
 * ## `isConnected` is wagmi's, and now that is the only view there is
 *
 * Under a vendor there were two notions of "connected" — a session, and an
 * account able to sign — and 48 call sites gate transactions on the second. The
 * distinction has collapsed: a connector is connected exactly when it holds a
 * live account, so `isAuthenticated` mirrors `isConnected` again. It stays in
 * the interface because it costs nothing and the difference returns the moment
 * a session layer does.
