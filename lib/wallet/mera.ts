/**
 * The passkey ceremony, on the APP origin.
 *
 * A passkey's WebAuthn PRF output is 32 secret bytes, and mera treats them as
 * a secp256k1 private key. This module runs the ceremony and returns those
 * bytes to the connector, which hands them straight to the wallet frame
 * (`lib/wallet/frame`) and zeroes its copy. That is the whole of what the
 * app origin does with the key now:
 *
 *   - it does NOT derive the address — the frame does;
 *   - it does NOT persist the key — the frame does, on its own origin, under
 *     a non-extractable wrapping key (`meraSession.ts`);
 *   - it does NOT sign — every signature is a request to the frame, which
 *     decides whether the request may be signed silently (`frame/policy.ts`).
 *
 * ## Why the ceremony stays here rather than moving into the frame
 *
 * WebAuthn in a cross-origin iframe needs a user gesture INSIDE that frame,
 * and the app has thirteen "Connect" entry points that are ordinary buttons on
 * the app's own origin. Moving the ceremony would turn each of those into a
 * two-step (open a dialog, click again inside the frame), and the brief for
 * this change was that nothing about the experience moves. So the tap
 * happens exactly where it did, and the bytes leave this origin one
 * `postMessage` later.
 *
 * Read that trade honestly: script on iter.cx that is present at the moment
 * of the tap can hook `navigator.credentials.get` and read the PRF output.
 * Script present at any OTHER moment — which is every moment for the 24 hours
 * a session lasts — gets nothing, where before it got the key from storage.
 * Closing the remaining window means the click has to land on the wallet
 * origin, which is the dialog-only design recorded in the custody doc.
 *
 * ## What is a pointer, and stays here
 *
 * The credential POINTER — credential id, transports, salt — in localStorage
 * in the clear, on THIS origin. None of it can produce a key without the
 * authenticator; all of it is needed to ask for the same PRF output again.
 * Losing it does not lose the account, it just means picking the passkey
 * from a list. It stays on the app origin because the ceremony that needs it
 * does.
 *
 * ## The salt is load-bearing and must never change
 *
 * Same passkey + same salt ⇒ same 32 bytes ⇒ same private key ⇒ same address.
 * Change `PRF_SALT` and every existing user silently gets a NEW address, with
 * their funds stranded at the old one and no error anywhere. It is stored
 * alongside the credential rather than assumed, so a future rotation is a
 * deliberate migration instead of an accident.
 *
 * ## Passkeys are origin-bound, and that is visible in the address
 *
 * WebAuthn scopes a credential to an rpId — this origin's hostname. `localhost`
 * and `iter.cx` are different origins, so the same human gets DIFFERENT
 * accounts on each. The wallet frame's origin plays no part in this: the
 * ceremony is here, so the rpId is the app's.
 *
 * ## Mera is 0.2.0 / preview
 *
 * This is key derivation: a defect loses funds irreversibly and silently. The
 * version is pinned and the module is kept small and readable for that reason.
