/**
 * A wagmi connector backed by the passkey account — with the key on another
 * origin.
 *
 * ## Why a connector rather than a side channel
 *
 * 48 call sites in this app gate on wagmi's `isConnected`, and every write goes
 * through `useWriteContract`. A signer the connector layer does not know about
 * is a signer none of that can see. Wrapping the passkey account as a
 * connector is what makes it a first-class wallet everywhere, with no call
 * site changed.
 *
 * ## The account is LOCAL to the wallet frame, not to this document
 *
 * Until 2026-09-18 this connector held a viem `LocalAccount` in a closure and
 * signed in-process. It now holds an ADDRESS and a handle on the wallet frame
 * (`lib/wallet/frame/client.ts`), a hidden iframe on the wallet origin that
 * keeps the key and does every signature. Script on this origin — including
 * an XSS — can ask the frame to sign; it cannot read the key, cannot read the
 * frame's storage, and cannot keep anything past the tab.
 *
 * Signing is still a pure computation from the app's point of view: a
 * transaction names its chain and the frame signs for it, so `switchChain`
 * cannot fail and never prompts. That property is what let the injected
 * connector go (see `lib/providers.tsx`) and it is unchanged.
 *
 * ## Reconnect must not prompt
 *
 * `WagmiProvider` runs `reconnect` on every mount with `isReconnecting: true`
 * — a page load, with no user gesture. A WebAuthn prompt from there is refused
 * by the browser, which throws, and wagmi answers a failed reconnect by
 * clearing the connection: the "connected then immediately disconnected" bug.
 * So reconnect takes the one path that cannot prompt — `frame.resume()`, which
 * decrypts a key the frame already holds — and throws when there is nothing
 * to resume, exactly as before.
 *
 * ## The confirm tier is not this connector's to sign
 *
 * A request the frame's policy sorts as value-moving (`frame/policy.ts`) is
 * refused here with `CONFIRM_REQUIRED` and goes through the visible confirm
 * frame instead (`components/Wallet/WalletConfirmFrame`). `useWriteContract`
 * on an ERC-20 `transfer` therefore FAILS on this connector, loudly — which is
 * the correct outcome for a path that would otherwise sign a withdrawal with
 * no human in the loop.
