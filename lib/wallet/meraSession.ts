/**
 * A time-boxed resume for the passkey wallet.
 *
 * ## What changed, and why this file exists
 *
 * The account key is the passkey's PRF output, and it used to live ONLY in a
 * live signing session — so a reload ended the session and the user tapped
 * their passkey again. That is the safest possible arrangement and it was the
 * documented design.
 *
 * It was also, in practice, a refresh logging people out. This file is the
 * deliberate trade: the key is persisted so a reload resumes silently, and the
 * exposure is bounded by an EXPIRY rather than by the lifetime of a tab.
 *
 * ## What "persisted" means here, precisely
 *
 * Not in localStorage in the clear. The key is encrypted with AES-GCM under a
 * **non-extractable** `CryptoKey` held in IndexedDB; only the ciphertext and
 * the IV go to localStorage. `extractable: false` is enforced by the browser,
 * so nothing — including this app — can read those bytes back out. Decryption
 * has to be performed BY the browser, ON this origin.
 *
 * That does not stop script running on this origin: anything that can call
 * `restoreMeraSession()` gets the key, so an XSS on iter.cx is still game over.
 * It stops the cheaper attacks that the plain version would hand over for free
 * — a browser-profile backup, a synced storage dump, an extension with
 * `storage` permission but no script injection, devtools on a borrowed laptop.
 * The expiry is what bounds the rest.
 *
 * ## The expiry is ABSOLUTE, not sliding
 *
 * `SESSION_TTL_MS` runs from the tap that unlocked the account, and using the
 * app does not extend it. A sliding window renews itself for exactly the person
 * who is active on the machine, which on a shared or stolen laptop is not the
 * owner — so it would be a session that never ends for the one case the expiry
 * is for. One tap a day is the price.
 *
 * ## Every failure reads as "no session"
 *
 * A missing wrapping key, a malformed record, a decrypt that does not
 * authenticate, an address that does not match the one recorded, IndexedDB
 * refused in a private window: all of them wipe and return null, which costs a
 * passkey tap. The opposite bias — proceeding on a record we could not fully
 * verify — is how a key gets used that nobody can account for.
