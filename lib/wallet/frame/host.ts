/**
 * The hidden frame's side of the protocol.
 *
 * Runs inside `<walletOrigin>/wallet-frame`, embedded invisibly by the app.
 * It answers exactly five methods (`protocol.ts`), for exactly one sender —
 * the window that embedded it, on the one origin `appOrigin()` names — and it
 * refuses the confirm tier outright: a value-moving request on this path is
 * answered with `CONFIRM_REQUIRED` and never signed, whatever the caller says
 * about it. The visible confirm frame is the only way those get signed.
 *
 * ## Why `event.source === window.parent` as well as the origin
 *
 * The origin check is the boundary. The source check is belt and braces
 * against the app origin holding more than one window that can reach this
 * frame — a popup the app opened, say — so that only the document that
 * embedded the frame can drive it.
 *
 * ## Stateless between requests
 *
 * Nothing is cached here. Status reads storage, resume and every signature
 * restore from storage, and a disconnect wipes storage. The frame can be
 * reloaded at any time and answers the same.
