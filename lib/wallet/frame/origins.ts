/**
 * Which origin holds the key, and which origin may ask it to sign.
 *
 * ## Two origins, two variables
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_ORIGIN` — read by the APP: where the wallet frame is
 * served, e.g. `https://wallet.iter.cx`. The app embeds `<origin>/wallet-frame`
 * and posts to it.
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_APP_ORIGIN` — read by the FRAME: the one origin whose
 * messages it answers, e.g. `https://iter.cx`. Every other sender is ignored.
 *
 * Both are `NEXT_PUBLIC_` because both are decided in the browser, and both
 * are baked at BUILD time — the same trap `ADMIN_SERVICE_URL` carries, so a
 * change needs a rebuild, not a restart. One deployment serves both hosts (see
 * `proxy.ts`), which is why the same build must know both values.
 *
 * ## Unset means same-origin, and same-origin means NO isolation
 *
 * With neither set, the frame is `<own origin>/wallet-frame`. Everything still
 * works — the protocol, the policy, the stored session — but the frame shares
 * localStorage and IndexedDB with the app, so script on the app can read what
 * the frame stored. That is the local-development shape, so `localhost` needs
 * no second host. `isIsolated()` reports which shape is running, and the
 * connector logs once in production when it finds the degraded one: a wallet
 * that quietly ships without its boundary is the failure this file exists to
 * make visible.
 *
 * ## The frame does not need to be a subdomain of the app
 *
 * The passkey ceremony runs on the APP origin (see `lib/wallet/mera.ts`), so
 * the rpId is still the app's hostname and nothing about WebAuthn constrains
 * where the frame lives. `wallet.iter.cx` reads well; any origin this
 * deployment answers on would work.
 */

/**
 * Parse an origin out of a configured value, or fall back.
 *
 * `new URL(...).origin` is the normaliser: it strips a path, a trailing slash
 * and a default port, and lower-cases the host — so a value pasted with any of
 * those still compares equal to `event.origin`, which the browser always
 * reports in that canonical form. A value that does not parse, or parses to
 * the literal `"null"` origin, takes the fallback: comparing an origin check
 * against garbage would fail closed, which is safe, and also fail silently,
 * which is not.
