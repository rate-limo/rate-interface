/**
 * A browser wallet used ONLY to send money to the passkey account.
 *
 * ## Deliberately outside wagmi
 *
 * `lib/providers.tsx` configures exactly one connector — the passkey — so
 * `useAccount()` anywhere in the app is the Iter wallet and every write is signed
 * by it. That is the whole point: an injected wallet signs only for the network
 * it is currently on, so as a SIGNER it forces a switch prompt on every
 * cross-chain trade. Removing it from the config removes that class of problem
 * outright.
 *
 * But MetaMask is still where people keep their money, so it keeps a job here —
 * as a funding source. This module talks to it directly over EIP-1193 rather
 * than through wagmi, and that separation is the design rather than an
 * implementation detail:
 *
 *   * nothing here can ever become `useAccount()`. There is no connector, no
 *     entry in the config, no shared store. A bug in this file cannot make the
 *     app sign with the wrong wallet, because the app has no way to reach it.
 *   * the external account is a local value with the lifetime of one deposit.
 *     It is not persisted, not reconnected on load, and not shown as "your"
 *     wallet anywhere.
 *
 * The one thing an injected wallet is good at — one transaction, on one chain,
 * right now — is exactly what a deposit is.

 * wallet could lead the list. Its own comment called `eth_chainId` "a silent
 * read that any EVM provider answers", which is true of MetaMask and Rabby and
 * is not a property of the interface. A wallet that treats the first request
 * from an unknown origin as a request to CONNECT opens its approval popup, so
 * visiting `/deposit` raised a dialog from every such extension installed —
 * before the user had picked anything, and from wallets they may never use.
 *
 * Nothing could have caught it here: every test drives a mock that answers what
 * it is told, so a wallet that prompts and one that does not are the same
 * object. The rule that replaced it is testable by counting instead — the first
 * request to any wallet is the one the user's Connect click makes, and
 * `DepositPanel.test.tsx` pins that no provider is spoken to before it.
 *
 * If a list ever needs filtering or ordering again, it has to be bought with a
