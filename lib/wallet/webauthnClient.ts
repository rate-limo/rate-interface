/**
 * mera's browser WebAuthn client, with three changes it does not make itself.
 *
 * mera keeps its ceremony minimal and does not export its default client, so
 * steering the ceremony means supplying one. This mirrors that client field for
 * field — same challenge, same transports, same assertion path — and changes
 * only what is below. Key derivation is untouched and stays mera's: this file
 * decides WHICH authenticator answers and HOW it is asked, never what is done
 * with its output.
 *
 * ## 0. `prf: {}` at creation instead of `prf: { eval }` — the actual bug
 *
 * See the comment at the extension itself. This is the one that turns
 * `PRF_UNAVAILABLE` into a working wallet on Chrome; the two below are why the
 * user reaches a usable authenticator at all.
 *
 * ## 1. `hints`, so the browser offers a choice
 *
 * With no hint, Chrome on macOS sends `create()` straight to the system
 * provider — iCloud Keychain — and a Mac with it switched off gets the OS
 * demanding it be turned on before any picker appears. That is the dialog users
 * see instead of being asked where to save.
 *
 * `hints` is WebAuthn Level 3 and Chrome honours it. Listing all three in
 * preference order makes the picker itself the first thing shown, which is what
 * a user expects — and here it is load-bearing, because PRF is the entire basis
 * of this wallet (mera treats its output as the secp256k1 private key) and not
 * every authenticator implements it. When the one the browser reaches for does
 * not, the only paths that work are the ones a picker reaches: another provider,
 * a phone over hybrid, or a security key.
 *
 * The order is deliberate and is documented at HINTS — leading with
 * `client-device` is what sent Chrome straight into the built-in authenticator
 * instead of offering a choice.
 *
 * ## 2. A capability preflight, so a dead passkey is not created
 *
 * mera can only check PRF AFTER `navigator.credentials.create()` has succeeded,
 * because that is when the authenticator reports it. So a provider without PRF
 * leaves a credential behind that this app can never use, and every retry
 * leaves another — a list of identical "Rate wallet" entries with no way to
 * delete them from script, since WebAuthn has no delete API.
 *
 * `PublicKeyCredential.getClientCapabilities()` reports `extension:prf` and is
 * the standard way to ask in advance. It is recent, so its ABSENCE proves
 * nothing and must not block: unknown means proceed and let mera's own check
 * decide. Only an explicit `false` refuses.
 */

/**
 * Does this browser say PRF is unavailable?
 *
 * Deliberately asymmetric, and the asymmetry is the point. `true` is returned
 * ONLY on an explicit negative. A browser too old for `getClientCapabilities`,
 * a thrown call, a missing key — all answer "not known to be unavailable", so
 * the ceremony still runs. Guessing the other way would refuse to create a
 * wallet on every browser that has not shipped the API yet.

    const caps = await pkc.getClientCapabilities();
    return caps["extension:prf"] === false;
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
}

/**
 * Preference order for where the passkey lives — and the order is the point.
 *
 * `hints` is ORDERED: Chrome takes the first entry as what the site prefers and
 * opens that flow. So `client-device` first does not mean "offer the built-in
 * one among others", it means "go straight to the built-in one" — which on
 * macOS is iCloud Keychain, and is what kept producing the "enable iCloud
 * Keychain" dialog instead of a choice.
 *
 * `client-device` leads because the providers that carry PRF on desktop are
 * PLATFORM authenticators — a Google Password Manager passkey reports
 * `transports: ["internal"]` just like an iCloud Keychain one. Leading with
 * `hybrid` steers into the phone flow, which is not a desktop answer.
 *
 * ## Desktop Chrome has three platform stores and only two carry PRF
 *
 * Per mera's own authenticator-support notes:
 * https://mera.category.xyz/authenticator-support/#the-desktop-chrome-complication
 *
 * Only passkeys saved to GOOGLE PASSWORD MANAGER carry PRF on desktop Chrome.
 * The LOCAL CHROME PROFILE authenticator has no `hmac-secret` and cannot.
 * iCloud Keychain does carry it, on macOS 15+.
 *
 * Chrome writes to the local profile instead of GPM when "Offer to save
 * passwords and passkeys" is off, when the profile is signed out, or when a
 * third-party password-manager extension intercepts WebAuthn. The credential is
 * created either way and simply returns no PRF — `{"prf":{"enabled":false}}`,
 * which at this layer is indistinguishable from an authenticator that has none.
 *
 * That is the real cause, and it is a SETTING rather than a limit: no hint
 * chooses between platform providers, so the throw below names the three
 * settings instead of pretending the ceremony can fix it.
 *
 * The picker itself is CHROME's UI, not something this app renders. All the app
 * can do is say what it prefers; what the browser shows, and in what order, is
 * the browser's decision.

        // does not do it: asked for `prf: { eval: ... }` it returns no `prf` in

        // true` from `getClientCapabilities()` — PRF is fully supported, it just
        // cannot be evaluated in the same ceremony that creates the credential.
