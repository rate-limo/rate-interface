/**
 * A record of transfers THIS APP submitted, in this browser.
 *
 * ## Read this before treating it as account history
 *
 * It is not one, and the UI must not present it as one. Nothing in this
 * monorepo indexes value transfers: the broker indexes the exchange's own
 * events — orders, fills, launches, band liquidity — and there is no handler
 * for an ERC-20 `Transfer`, which is also why the token profile's holders
 * column is a share of TRADED supply rather than of supply.
 *
 * So a deposit someone makes by scanning the QR from a phone is invisible here,
 * on every device including the one that generated the QR. What this file
 * records is the subset the app itself put on chain and therefore knows the
 * hash of: a browser-wallet deposit, and a withdrawal.
 *
 * That is a real limit, not a temporary one, and the panel says so rather than
 * showing an empty list that reads as "you have never deposited". Making it
 * complete needs an indexer handler for `Transfer` filtered to the account, at
 * which point this becomes a local cache in front of it and the shape below
 * does not change.
 *
 * Local for the same reason `addressBook` is: there is no account table in this
 * monorepo, and inventing one to hold a transfer log is a privacy decision this
 * change is not entitled to make.
