/**
 * Saved withdrawal destinations, in this browser.
 *
 * ## Why local, and why that is not a placeholder
 *
 * There is no account table in this monorepo. `privyUsers` / `privyWallets` were
 * dropped with Privy and held zero rows; the app stores a wallet address and
 * nothing else, which is what `/privacy` says. A server-side address book would
 * therefore be the first table that binds a person's saved payees to their
 * wallet — a real privacy decision, not an implementation detail, and one this
 * change is not entitled to make on its own.
 *
 * So the book lives in `localStorage`, and the UI says so rather than implying a
 * sync that does not happen. If it later moves to a service, only `read`/`write`
 * change; nothing else in the app touches the storage key.
 *
 * ## Validation is not optional here
 *
 * These values reach a `to:` field in a transaction. A hand-edited or corrupted
 * entry must be dropped on the way OUT of storage as well as on the way in —
 * the same rule `lib/referral/pending` follows for a code that reaches a URL,
 * and the stakes here are higher: the worst case is funds sent somewhere the
 * user never typed.
